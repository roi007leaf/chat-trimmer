# Chat Trimmer

A Foundry VTT module that automatically compresses chat history using intelligent pattern recognition. Reduces memory usage by 80-90% while preserving important information in searchable, organized archives. **No LLM or external services required!**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Large chat logs consume memory and cause performance degradation
- Purging chat loses important campaign information
- Players and GMs need to scroll through hundreds of messages to find information
- Existing archive solutions dump raw logs without summarization

## ✨ Solution

**Intelligent compression** that reduces 500+ messages to ~50 organized summaries using algorithm-based pattern recognition.

## 🚀 Features

[15:32:20] Alice: Initiative
[15:32:20] 🎲 Alice rolled 1d20+4: 18
[15:32:22] Goblin 1: Initiative
[15:32:22] 🎲 Goblin 1 rolled 1d20+1: 8
... [41 more messages] ...
```

### After (Combat Summary + Key Events)

```text

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Algorithm-Based Detection

The module uses pattern recognition algorithms to detect:

1. **Combat Encounters**
   - Initiative rolls and combat start/end markers
   - Attack rolls, damage, hits/misses
   - Critical hits and fumbles
   - Character knockouts and deaths
   - Round tracking and combat outcome detection

2. **Key Events (Session Highlights)**
   - Critical successes/failures via PF2e flags and content parsing
   - Death saves and recovery checks
   - Dying, death, unconscious, and wounded conditions
   - Hero Point usage
   - High-level spells (4th level and above)
   - XP gains and level ups
   - Major item transfers (100+ gold, legendary items, treasure)
   - Persistent damage and debilitating conditions

3. **Message Classification**
   - Multi-category support (entries can belong to multiple categories)
   - Combat, Rolls, Speech, Emotes, Whispers, Healing, Items, Important
   - PF2e-specific roll type detection (attack-roll, damage-roll, skill-check, saving-throw)
   - Skill check action extraction (e.g., "Grapple (Athletics Check)")

4. **Smart Compression**
   - Groups related messages by combat encounter
   - Extracts key information (actors, targets, outcomes, damage)
   - Generates human-readable summaries
   - Preserves roll data for recreation
   - Maintains chronological order

### Data Storage

- **External JSON Storage** (Recommended): Stores archives as JSON files in `Data/chat-trimmer-archives/`
  - Better performance for large archives
  - Easier to backup and transfer
  - Indexed in world settings for fast access

- **Journal Entry Storage**: Stores archives as Journal Entries in "Chat Archives" folder
  - Native Foundry integration
  - No external files needed
  - May impact performance with very large archives

Each archive contains:

- Compressed entries with original message references
- Extracted data (participants, locations, items, damage)
- Search keywords for full-text search
- Session statistics and metadata
- Key events list for session summary
- Roll data for button recreation

## 🎯 Performance

- **Memory Reduction**: 80-90% reduction in chat data
- **Processing Speed**: 500 messages processed in <5 seconds
- **Search Speed**: Full-text search results in <1 second
- **Archive Loading**: Pagination ensures fast loading even with thousands of entries
- **Storage Options**: External JSON recommended for optimal performance with large archives
- **UI Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations keep Foundry responsive during trim

## 🔮 Future Features (Roadmap)

### Enhanced Compression

- Dialogue thread detection and compression
- Skill check clustering
- Location tracking and scene changes
- Advanced keyword extraction with NPC/location recognition

### User Experience Improvements

- Progress indicators during trim operations
- Archive comparison tools
- Session timeline visualization
- Statistics dashboard with charts

### Advanced Features

- Export to PDF/JSON/Markdown
- Undo/restore operations
- Custom compression rules and filters
- Archive retention policies (auto-delete old archives)
- Integration with other modules (Simple Calendar, etc.)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chat not trimming

- Ensure you're a GM (only GMs can trim chat)
- Check that there are messages to trim beyond the "Messages to Keep" threshold
- Verify "Enable Automatic Trimming" is turned on (if using auto-trim)
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages

### Archives not showing

- For Journal storage: Check the "Chat Archives" journal folder
- For External JSON storage: Verify files exist in `Data/chat-trimmer-archives/`
- Try refreshing Foundry VTT (F5)
- Verify module is enabled in Module Management

### Archive Viewer issues

- If entries don't load: Check Storage Type setting and ensure files/journals exist
- If search doesn't work: Press Enter after typing your search query
- If pagination is broken: Check browser console for errors

### Performance issues

- Switch to External JSON storage (recommended for large archives)
- Reduce "Messages to Keep Visible" setting
- Decrease auto-trim thresholds
- Check console (F12) for errors or warnings

### Key Events not showing

- Ensure you're on version 1.0.6 or later
- Trim new messages after updating to capture key events
- Check that messages have PF2e flags or critical content
- Expand session summary to view key events list

## 💻 Developer API

Access module functionality programmatically via console:

```javascript
// Get module instance
const chatTrimmer = game.modules.get("chat-trimmer")?.instance;

// Manual trim (ignores "Messages to Keep" setting)
await chatTrimmer.trimmer.trim(null, { ignoreKeep: true });

// View archive viewer
const viewer = new game.modules.get("chat-trimmer").ArchiveViewerV2(
  chatTrimmer.archiveManager,
);
viewer.render(true);

// Access archive manager
const archiveManager = chatTrimmer.archiveManager;

// Get all archives
const archives = await archiveManager.getAllArchives();

// Get specific archive entries
const entries = await archiveManager.getArchiveEntries(archive);

// Generate session summary
const summary = await archiveManager.generateSessionSummary(archive, entries);

// Delete an archive
await archive.delete();
```

### Hooks

Listen to module events:

```javascript
// Before trim starts
Hooks.on("chatTrimmer.beforeTrim", (messages, options) => {
  console.log(`About to trim ${messages.length} messages`);
});

// After trim completes
Hooks.on("chatTrimmer.afterTrim", (archive, result) => {
  console.log(`Trimmed to ${result.compressionRatio}% compression`);
});
```
